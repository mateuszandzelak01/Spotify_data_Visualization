# Spotify Data Visualization

In this project I create a Dashbord in Power BI with my private data from Spotify. I use API to connect with Spotify to generate data with music genres. From Spotify I get mail with JSON files that include my priavate data (streaming history, my library, payments etc.) genarally about what kind of songs I listened in the last year. I operated on the data using Python and 3 libraries (Numpy, Pandas, Requests) all my work I saved in Jupyter Notebook with desription to every steps.
